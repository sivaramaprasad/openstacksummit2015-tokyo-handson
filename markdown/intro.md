Note:
- All examples given in this talk are available from GitHub so you can
  follow along.


You'll
# need
an OpenStack environment
Note:
- Following along requires that you currently have access to an
  OpenStack cluster via its Keystone, Nova, Glance and Neutron APIs
  (first part) and also via the Heat API (second part).


If you're
### not able
or
### not inclined
to follow along,
## that's OK.
Just listen and participate in the discussion.
Note:
- If you do not have access to your own cluster right now, you can
  still follow along, ask questions, poke holes in my templates, and
  try the material next time you're back at the office.
